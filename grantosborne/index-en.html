              <p style="color: #F7CFA5;">My Calling</p>                
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">I have the greatest job in the world. No, I actually have one of the greatest, if not the greatest, jobs in all of human history (apart from Christ’s, that is). My point is this: there is a God, and he raised Jesus from the dead, brought salvation to mankind, and spoke directly to us through his revealed Word. What can be better than proclaiming this salvation and teaching his Word to an incredibly needy world? That is exactly what I have been doing for fifty years, but now at the end of my journey I get to put everything I have learned together and spend my remaining years studying his Word more deeply than ever and communicating the results to God’s people. I get to produce a set of Bible studies/commentaries on the entire New Testament for the church. As I look back, I believe God was uniquely preparing me, my entire life for this moment.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">My career has centered on two aspects of ministry—pastoring churches and teaching seminary students. I have pastored two churches and been interim pastor of three others. I have taught in two seminaries for a total of 43 years. But let me step behind that first. I learned long ago that every time I study his Word devotionally it is not enough just to sit in my prayer room and meditate. I want to share the results with others. That started back in high school. Nothing beats the joy of passing on His truths to others and seeing them get excited too. That has carried over into being a pastor and a teacher. I love preaching and teaching, but I’ve discovered I love the whole process. Sermon preparation is actually devotional Bible study.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">As I have taught seminary students over the years, I have always pictured them in the pulpit or the classroom sharing what I am giving them with others. It is 2 Timothy 2:2 at work, “And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.” I am engaged in the most important relay race in history, passing the baton off to “reliable people” who will continue to pass it on from generation to generation. One of the great joys is travelling around the world and seeing grads who have had me in class continuing to share the truths they have received. I feel a part of me is all over the world!</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">Writing commentaries like the series I am doing now is in reality simply teaching on a much larger canvas. I picture Christians around the country and around the world sitting in my classroom reading my lessons and setting out to share the truths about God’s revealed Word with others. Even after fifty years of studying and sharing I still get thrilled as I see the deep treasures of meaning about Galatians or Romans uncovered for the time to me, and then I have the privilege of writing them down to thrill countless others who will read them in the near future. It doesn’t get much better than this! So in a sense each commentary is a series of sermons or of seminary classes delivered one after another in the pages of a book that is far more than a book. It is buried treasure uncovered for all to see! And God has allowed me to participate in the process by which he unlocks these treasures.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">The result: I love God’s Word more than ever. This series of taking the results of hundreds of years wrestling about the meaning of these New Testament books by men and women of God for two thousand years and sharing the current understandings of these wondrous truths with God’s people in the church has me more excited than I’ve ever been. Academic commentaries are incredibly important and must be done, but the process is not finished with them. I know; I’ve done several. Their problem is that they keep these wonderful truths within the academy and put the results high on the shelf of academia far from the eyes of the people in the church. They are above the heads of the rest of us. Yet the truths they uncover are so important. So the task of taking the cookies off the shelf and putting them on the table to be enjoyed is incredibly exciting to me. That is what I am trying to do, and it is a thrilling process to be part of.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">For many of you readers, this commentary series may be the first ones you have ever read. I want this to be an exciting first foray into the world of the biblical texts, so that as you enter this adventure the journey is fun and filled with meaning. For others this commentary may be one of many you are consulting. Having done both kinds, the academic and the lay commentary, how will these commentaries enhance the more detailed coverage in the others. My recommendation is that you consult this one first to get a lay of the land, to see the whole field of meaning laid out for you before getting bogged down in the minutia of detail in the longer volumes. My commentary will help you to see the issues and understand them clearly so that you can get more out of all the confusing details in the others.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">Just for fun, let me share on a question I am often asked. After all the decades of teaching and writing, do I have a favorite biblical theme or theological topic? I have reflected on my life’s verse an enormous amount, 2 Timothy 2:15, “Work very hard to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, correctly handling the word of truth.” That pictures me standing before God, ashamed because I have been shallow in my “handling” of his Word. My whole career has been an attempt to teach and preach his Word deeply and accurately, teaching my students to do the same. So a favorite topic has always been discipleship and the responsibility, but even more the joy and privilege, of communicating His Word to others. At the same time, I am known by students as a person whose favorite passage is the one I am on right now, as they hear me constantly say, “Wow, isn’t this a great verse?!”</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE;">A final comment: I have been asked which of the commentaries in this series will best demonstrate these points. That is hard to say. For background information, the Gospels are best, because every passage will have a new set of historical background passages to uncover. I love historical background; it turns a two-dimensional lesson into a three-dimensional IMAX event. The hearer enters the world behind the text and experiences it anew through background. For sheer exciting new learning, the Book of Revelation cannot be beat. Most of us are a little afraid and confused by the bewildering images. Yet it is a truly wondrous book, and its message is so relevant for our day. I absolutely love teaching it! Among the epistles, it is a hard choice. For devotional value, I love Ephesians and Philippians (or 1 Peter for that matter); for theology, I love Romans or Hebrews. For practical church issues, 1 Corinthians is so valuable. Tough choices!</p>

              <span style="color: #CECECE;"><p class="text-left"><span style="color: #F7CFA5;">编者按</span>：在奥斯邦七十岁生日那年，他的同事、朋友和学生，为了纪念他在新约注释书的众多著作对学术界与教会的贡献，特别编写了21篇文章，由国际学术界享誉盛名的 Brill 出版社结集成书。本文是纪念文集的两位编辑为此书编写的前言。</p> 
              <p style="color: #F7CFA5;">格兰特·奥斯邦教授</p>                
              <p>艾克哈德·席纳博 斯坦利·波特<sup>[1]</sup></p>
              <p class="text-left">格兰特·奥斯邦于1942年7月7日出生在纽约市皇后区，父母都是职业音乐人。他的父亲是小号手，与当地及外地的大型乐队几乎都有过合作。第二次世界大战期间，他们全家搬到印第安纳州的韦恩堡，在那里他们开始参加当地一间教会，并成为委身的基督徒。</p>
              <p class="text-left">高中时期，他经人介绍参加了青年归主协会 （Youth for Christ）聚会，那些信徒认真查考圣经，这促使他背诵新旧约经文，并最终入读韦恩堡圣经学院（Fort Wayne Bible College），主修宣教和教牧培养。</p>
              <p class="text-left">在本科学习期间，格兰特作为T.E.A.M.的学生工作者，在巴基斯坦北部的阿伯塔巴德（Abbottabad）生活了六个月。他患有慢性支气管炎，海外宣教之路因此受阻，于是格兰特转向教牧事工，在俄亥俄州纽瓦克第一基督教联合教会（First Christian Union Church）担任牧师三年。他将释经式讲道介绍给那里的会众，同时担负起教会里数量众多且耗时的期望，其中包括指挥一个全教会的诗班（格兰特指挥演出了韩德尔的《弥赛亚》！）。每周准备三篇讲道的任务让格兰特兴奋不已，不断研读希腊文也令他充满活力，他做好了准备，期待进一步研读神的话语。</p>
              <p class="text-left">接下来，他入读伊利诺伊州迪尔菲尔德的三一神学院（Trinity Evangelical Divinity School），于1971年获得新约圣经研究的文学硕士学位。随后他接受了他在三一神学院的教授理查德·朗格纳克（Richard Longenecker）的挑战，去英国攻读博士学位。为了预备在欧洲的博士学习，格兰特在三一神学院教导希腊语和希伯来语，驾驶校车，并在芝加哥地区的一间教会担任临时牧师，而他的妻子南希（他们在俄亥俄州时结婚）在小学教书。</p>
              <p class="text-left">格兰特有幸成为霍华德·马歇尔（I. Howard Marshall）在阿伯丁大学（Aberdeen University）的第一个博士学生。1974年，他的博士论文通过答辩，论文题目是《复活叙事中的历史与神学：编修鉴别法》（History and Theology in the Resurrection Narratives: A Redactional Study）。毕业后，奥斯邦博士接受了加拿大温尼伯神学院（Winnipeg Theological Seminary）（现为普罗维登斯神学院 Providence Theological Seminary）的呼召，于1974年至1977年在该院任教，后来搬到迪尔菲尔德，自1977年起担任三一神学院的新约教授，至今已有35年。</p>
              <p class="text-left">格兰特曾在英国剑桥大学（University of Cambridge）和德国马尔堡的菲利普大学（Philipps-Universität）从事研究，并在韩国、香港及中国讲学。他曾为《TSF新闻与评论》（<i>TSF News and Reviews</i>）担任新约编辑，为《IVP新约注释丛书》（<i>IVP New Testament Commentary,</i> IVP出版）担任总编辑，在《生命应用注释系列》（<i>Life Application Commentary，</i>丁道尔出版）、《三个关键问题丛书》（<i>Three Crucial Questions，</i>贝克出版）和圣经新普及译本中，也曾担任编辑之一。</p>
              <p class="text-left">奥斯邦教授感兴趣的一个主要领域是释经学，他将这一事实与他的论文研究、他对宣教的兴趣以及牧养的职责联系在一起，使圣经的意义能够从圣经文本“迁移”到当代听众面前。他在论文中探讨福音书的复活叙事时<sup>[2]</sup>，采用了编修鉴别学（redaction criticism）的多种方法，这门学科由汉斯·康泽尔曼（Hans Conzelmann）<sup>[3]</sup>、威利·马克森（Willi Marxsen）<sup>[4]</sup>和贡特·博恩卡姆（Günther Bornkamm）<sup>[5]</sup>提出，早于他写论文二十年。奥斯邦博士为不同词典、<sup>[6]</sup>释经法教材、<sup>[7]</sup>期刊<sup>[8]</sup>和书籍<sup>[9]</sup>撰写了多篇文章，重新讨论编修鉴别学，为之辩护，认为在福音书研究中采用该学科的技巧与方法是合适的，他的观点是特别针对部分福音派人士，他们认为编修鉴别学与保守的圣经观点不相容。<sup>[10]</sup></p>
              <p class="text-left">格兰特用拳击作比喻，描述福音派关于编修鉴别学的第一轮辩论，此事发生在1978年福音派神学协会年会上，[11]针对奥斯邦于1976年和1978年在《福音派神学协会杂志》（<i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i>）上发表的文章，约翰·沃里克·蒙哥马利（<i>John Warwick Montgomery</i>）予以了抨击，奥斯邦则极力为自己辩护，<sup>[12]</sup>申明他绝对没有暗示福音派编造了耶稣的生平或话语。第二轮辩论始于罗伯特·甘德瑞（Robert Gundry）《马太福音注释》的出版，<sup>[13]</sup>该注释书受到一些福音派学者的批评。<sup>[14]</sup>第三轮辩论发生在《今日基督教》（<i>Christianity Today</i>）组织的福音派学者研讨会，<sup>[15]</sup>以及塔尔博特神学院（Talbot School of Theology）的教员发表的立场文件。<sup>[16]</sup>格兰特评论了这场辩论，从他的言辞中可以看到，他愿意改变或修正他所持的立场。当时有批评认为，编修鉴别学者倾向于否认一种可能性，即为了按照年代顺序来描述历史上的耶稣，可以协调福音书的记载；他们也倾向于怀疑另一种可能性，就是重建耶稣的神学或确切话语。</p>
              <p class="text-left">针对上述批评，奥斯邦教授在1986年的文章中这样回应：“我承认，对于某个时期的我，这种批评言之有理。在我最初关于复活叙事的论文中，我淡化了协调这些叙事的可能性。然而，当我在七年的时间里重新修改我的论文时，我逐渐意识到，在素材允许的范围内，这样的协调不仅是可行的，而且是重要的。”<sup>[17]</sup>他对纠正和继续学习保持开放态度，这在最近的福音派神学协会年会上尤为显著。当时他任教的神学院有一位学生（其年纪还及不上格兰特的执教年数）对他的某个具体立场提出了质疑。在那位学生演讲结束时，格兰特举手发表点评，他告诉那位学生，他说服了他，并强调说，我们写作时都当做好犯错的准备。</p>
              <p class="text-left">与那些专注于使用某一种释经方法的学者不同，格兰特使用过历史鉴别学、<sup>[18]</sup>传统批评、<sup>[19]</sup>文体/形式鉴别学、<sup>[20]</sup>文学理论、<sup>[21]</sup>预表论、<sup>[22]</sup>处境化、<sup>[23]</sup>以及常规的圣经释经学。<sup>[24]</sup>特别重要的是他颇具影响力的教科书《释经学螺旋》（The Hermeneutical Spiral），<sup>[25]</sup>获得了1993年《今日基督教》神学和圣经研究评论家选择奖。继1991年精装版之后，这本书1997年出版了平装版，2006年出版了增订第二版。截至2011年10月，这三个版本的总销量已超过5万册。<sup>[26]</sup>该书已译成汉语、匈牙利语和葡萄牙语，翻译为阿拉伯语、印度尼西亚语和韩语的工作也正在进行中。</p>
              <p class="text-left">格兰特不仅学术研究硕果累累，对学生的影响也是直接并深远。本书的多位作者都曾是奥斯邦博士在三一神学院的学生，其中一些人还担任过他的助教。与奥斯邦博士一起工作是一种殊荣，并创造了一个近距离观察他的机会。这使学生能够与他更密切地讨论事工中的问题，特别是新约研究中的问题，甚至能够阅读和校对他的主要作品，可以说，这些作品尚未出版，他们就已经知悉。如果你应邀阅读和回应一篇文章，然后意识到，无论是当时还是现在，这些文章将把福音派学者带入前所未知的水域，这真是一种很难用言语形容的殊荣。</p>
              <p class="text-left">在奥斯邦博士的课程里修读的学生一定会记得，他为他们准备了大量笔记，让他们提前阅读——基本上是相关主题或新约书籍的学术汇编——这些笔记为课堂讨论搭建了背景。其中有一门释经学课程的笔记，后来成为奥斯邦教授最重要的出版物之一《释经学螺旋》的基础。在他撰写那些笔记的年代，三一神学院的学生可能是所有福音派学术圈中少数接触结构主义和其他非传统释经学流派的人。本书的一位编辑清楚记得，在《约翰文集》这门课程快结束时（因为它不是对观福音书，也不是使徒行传或保罗书信，三一的学生戏称其为“剩菜剩饭”），一位学生问奥斯邦博士，他会如何使用刚刚学习和讨论过的材料来讲解一段经文。奥斯邦博士立即开始了一段热情洋溢的讲道。那不是对约翰书信的简短释经，而是惟有“深刻感人”才足以形容。奥斯邦博士展示了如何从文本和学术研究顺畅地过渡到经文应用，但或许更重要的，是展示出他对神话语的属灵热忱和全然委身，这是他持之以恒在所有学生和同事面前传讲的，也是他在生命中彰显的。那次即兴讲道，源于多年来对神话语的研读和默想。在格兰特指导下的几年里，留下了许多这样的回忆，但那次回忆依然鲜活生动。</p>
              <p class="text-left">在格兰特看来，对释经学的关注不是目的，释经学也不是一门理论学科，而是由神学问题和终极的牧养问题所推动，正如他在多篇文章<sup>[27]</sup>和多个词典条目中<sup>[28]</sup>所表明的那样。他在芝加哥地区和其他地区的许多教会进行讲道和教学，这体现了他对教会的委身。在过去的10年，他的喜乐之一是参与一项战略事工，就是教导来自中国大陆的牧师们。这一评价，可从格兰特投入的一个主要项目（或许是最后一个）来印证：他开始研究教会的圣经神学，这证实了他的一个观点，即真正的圣经学术研究总会使教会受益。</p>
              <p class="text-left">奥斯邦教授亲切随和，乐观开朗，极为看重友情，深深的谦卑，关注真理，热爱神的话语，他的同事和学生一直因为他的品格而深受感动。此外，他有时还表现出令人捧腹的自嘲式幽默感。他可能会因为这本文集和其中对他的关注而感到尴尬，不过，他可能会同意，如果这本文集中收录的关于写作注释书的文章能帮助学者写出更好的圣经注释，促使牧者预备更好的讲道，那么他作为学者、神学家和牧者的首要目标就得以实现了：唯独神的荣耀（Soli Deo Gloria）。</p>

              <p>At the beginning of Timothy's Training International (TTi), Dr. Osborne proposed a vision, “To invite leading biblical scholars from around the world to teach every book of the Bible to fellow pastors and ministers of mainland China”. That was over 20 years ago, and since then, TTi has been following this vision and teaching the Bible faithfully.</p>
              <p>This webpage is our tribute to Dr. Osborne. It is also our wish that the vision of “teaching the Bible faithfully” will continue to inspire TTi's coworkers and students to devote themselves to this ministry. May we, like Dr. Osborne and other pioneer saints, do our utmost in “rightly handling the word of truth” of the Bible (2 Tim 2:15), and spreading the fragrance of the life of Christ.</p>

                <p>I remembered what a brother from Wenzhou once shared with me. He had already studied hermeneutics with different people five or six times before he took the hermeneutics course with Dr. Osborne. He wondered what Dr. Osborne would be teaching. Then, in the middle of the class, he cried, and he never thought he would cry in a class on hermeneutics.<br>I myself had studied Romans with Dr. Osborne. By that time he was already weak, and he had to sit through the whole lectures. Our leader Mr. Chan asked him how he was going to teach Romans, and he said, “Verse by verse”.

                  I remembered what a brother from Wenzhou once shared with me. He had already studied hermeneutics with different people five or six times before he took the hermeneutics course with Dr. Osborne. He wondered what Dr. Osborne would be teaching. Then, in the middle of the class, he cried, and he never thought he would cry in a class on hermeneutics.
                  <br>I myself had studied Romans with Dr. Osborne. By that time he was already weak, and he had to sit through the whole lectures. Our leader Mr. Chan asked him how he was going to teach Romans, and he said, “Verse by verse”. During the lectures, he would sit with a Bible in front of him, glancing at it only occasionally when he read the verses, and for the 36 hours of the class, without any other materials, he completed the teaching on Romans.
                  <br>——Letus<br>
                  <br>I took two of Dr. Osborn's classes and was called a "fan of O" by my classmates! As a leading biblical scholar, Dr. Osborne struck me with his deep humility. Dr. Osborn also made a great contribution to make it possible for us to study here in Hong Kong. I am thankful that he is now breathing freely in heaven! 
                  <br>——Nana<br>
                  <br>Dr. Osborn’s teaching on Revelation was mind-blowing with strong messages. He strongly encouraged me to study in an English-speaking seminary. “It’s just like when you wrote case studies in that American law school. If you could write legal memo, then you can study in an English-speaking seminary”, he said. I asked him, "Can women preach?" He gave me a clear answer, "Yes." "Can women serve as a leader?" Again he said clearly, "Sure."
                  <br>I remembered and cherished Dr. Osborne for his nurturing, edification, encouragement to the students, and his help to students to fulfill their dreams. I am glad that I finally went abroad and finished my seminary studies. If there was any regret, it was that I should have taken his advice earlier to go abroad and study in a seminary.
                  <br>——Melissa<br>
                  <br>The first time I came to study at TTi, I took the course on Revelation with Dr. Osborne. His teaching helped me find interests in learning theology. I still remembered him saying in the course of hermeneutics, "There is no such thing as boring theology, only bad teachers." Scot McKnight was a former student and colleague of Dr. Osborne, and as Scot recollected, Dr. Osborne suffered from chronic asthma throughout his lifetime, and he said the first thing he would do in heaven was to take a deep breath. Mcknight said that now Dr. Osborne can fully enjoy his breathing in the glory of God
                  <br>——Reli<br>
                  <br>I took two intensive courses with Dr. Osborn: Romans, Jude and 1&2 Peter. I was so sad to hear that he passed away. I knew the Lord took him and I could not help crying. I remembered that back in June he was still talking in the video that he was planning on writing several commentaries, which we won't see anymore ......
                  <br>——Daniel<br>
                  <br>I have attended the intensive course twice in Hong Kong, and I chose the class of Dr. Osborn both times. Although I liked diversity, and I knew that the professors of other classes were also the best, and the opportunities were rare, Dr. Osborn's class on Romans attracted me like a magnet. I could see what Jesus our Lord was like and felt the breath of his life in that class. As Dr. Osborne lectured on Romans, many passages that were confusing and difficult to me turned into refreshing living water. I remembered one of his analogies: sin is like an army that attempts to build bridgeheads at the weak points of our life, then breaks through the defenses of our life step by step ...... His expression was serious and his gestures were powerful when he gave that analogy, and I sensed his warning as well as exhortation to us. He was already weak when he taught us Romans, and he had to sit the whole week. But even though he was weak and frail he had the strength to teach. As he taught the Bible, he also lived out the strength in Christ, and his life testimony has had a long-lasting influence on my service to this day! Daniel
                  <br>——Daniel<br>
                  <br>I cried because I will never have the chance to listen to his hermeneutics class again. Michael
                  <br>——Michael<br>
                  <br>It was sad to hear that Dr. Osborn passed away. I recalled the classes I had taken with him, his powerful voice, and an unceasing vitality in his frail body. I was deeply touched by his passionate teaching and felt that he was also a shepherd who prayed. May he rest in peace in the Lord!
                  <br>——Moon<br>
                  <br>When I first heard the news of Dr. Osborn's death, I was so sad that I didn't want to say anything. Now I have just calmed down a little bit. While Dr. Osborn was teaching the Book of Romans, I was taking Deuteronomy with Dr. Block, just next to Dr. Osborne’s class. I liked both courses, but I could only choose one. I was grateful that later we were able to study Romans with Dr. Osborn through the class videos, which took us 8 months to finish. 
                  <br>——Lily<br>
                  <br>Dr. Osborn had a great influence on me (although I never met him in person). After I took Dr. Osborn's video class on Romans, I was moved to praying consistently for an opportunity to come and take intensive courses here. I miss him. 
                  <br>——Hong<br>
                  <br>I would like to listen to Dr. Osborn's lectures again through the videos. His life is a great testimony. 
                  <br>——Linyun<br>
                  <br>It happened that last week I started reading the Commentary on Romans by Dr. Osborn. Unfortunately, I never took a course with him. Now after reading his commentary I would like to take a class from him.
                  <br>——Mist<br>
                  <br>"For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel." (Ezra 7:10 ) Dr. Osborn told us in his sermon, "This verse has defined my life." That testimony has stayed with me until this day!
                  <br>——Xiaoming<br>
                  <br>Thank you, Dr. Osborn! As you taught me the Hermeneutical Spiral of Bible exposition, I have been practicing it since then. The method has enabled me to taste the sweetness of God’s word when I allow the Bible to speak for itself. I have also learned to meditate day and night the word of God, so to keep it in my heart. These practice has helped me find the confession of my life: “To live is to serve, and to serve is to live”. I love you, Dr. Osborne! 
                  <br>——Gump<br>
                  <br>Dr. Osborne was like a real-life Santa Clause to me, a gentle and loving scholar-pastor. What impressed me the most in his class was not his proficiency in Greek, but his message of love through his teaching of truth. I was at the valley of my ministry back then, and when I heard him saying "God is good", I cried for half of the class. That was almost eight years ago, yet that memory is still fresh and alive today. I miss you, Dr. Osborne!
                  <br>——Betsy<br>
                  <br>Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! (Psalm 150:6) 
                  <br>——Zhishi<br>
                  <br>I was grateful that when I came to study at TTi, my first class was Romans taught by Dr. Osborne, which gave me a whole new perspective on “seminary courses”. Dr. Osborne was an Arminian, but he said, "I can list 30 verses from the Bible that support Arminianism and 30 verses that support Calvinism." I learned from Dr. Osborne's profound knowledge and his own example that I should humble myself in the face of biblical truth, be tolerant and open to views that differ from my own position, and to learn with a humble heart. Dr. Osborn is a good example of mature Christian life. He was a best benchmark for me to learn from. 
                  <br>——Bryan<br>
                  <br>Now I think for those saints who suffered so much physically in this world, it is wonderful that they can rest in peace, awaiting the resurrection of their body! Although Dr. Osborne’s departure was a sad thing to his family and friends, yet we should rejoice that he was finally released.
