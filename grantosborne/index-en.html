              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.5;">I have the greatest job in the world. No, I actually have one of the greatest, if not the greatest, jobs in all of human history (apart from Christ’s, that is). My point is this: there is a God, and he raised Jesus from the dead, brought salvation to mankind, and spoke directly to us through his revealed Word. What can be better than proclaiming this salvation and teaching his Word to an incredibly needy world? That is exactly what I have been doing for fifty years, but now at the end of my journey I get to put everything I have learned together and spend my remaining years studying his Word more deeply than ever and communicating the results to God’s people. I get to produce a set of Bible studies/commentaries on the entire New Testament for the church. As I look back, I believe God was uniquely preparing me, my entire life for this moment.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.5">My career has centered on two aspects of ministry—pastoring churches and teaching seminary students. I have pastored two churches and been interim pastor of three others. I have taught in two seminaries for a total of 43 years. But let me step behind that first. I learned long ago that every time I study his Word devotionally it is not enough just to sit in my prayer room and meditate. I want to share the results with others. That started back in high school. Nothing beats the joy of passing on His truths to others and seeing them get excited too. That has carried over into being a pastor and a teacher. I love preaching and teaching, but I’ve discovered I love the whole process. Sermon preparation is actually devotional Bible study.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.5">As I have taught seminary students over the years, I have always pictured them in the pulpit or the classroom sharing what I am giving them with others. It is 2 Timothy 2:2 at work, “And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.” I am engaged in the most important relay race in history, passing the baton off to “reliable people” who will continue to pass it on from generation to generation. One of the great joys is travelling around the world and seeing grads who have had me in class continuing to share the truths they have received. I feel a part of me is all over the world!</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.5">Writing commentaries like the series I am doing now is in reality simply teaching on a much larger canvas. I picture Christians around the country and around the world sitting in my classroom reading my lessons and setting out to share the truths about God’s revealed Word with others. Even after fifty years of studying and sharing I still get thrilled as I see the deep treasures of meaning about Galatians or Romans uncovered for the time to me, and then I have the privilege of writing them down to thrill countless others who will read them in the near future. It doesn’t get much better than this! So in a sense each commentary is a series of sermons or of seminary classes delivered one after another in the pages of a book that is far more than a book. It is buried treasure uncovered for all to see! And God has allowed me to participate in the process by which he unlocks these treasures.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.6">The result: I love God’s Word more than ever. This series of taking the results of hundreds of years wrestling about the meaning of these New Testament books by men and women of God for two thousand years and sharing the current understandings of these wondrous truths with God’s people in the church has me more excited than I’ve ever been. Academic commentaries are incredibly important and must be done, but the process is not finished with them. I know; I’ve done several. Their problem is that they keep these wonderful truths within the academy and put the results high on the shelf of academia far from the eyes of the people in the church. They are above the heads of the rest of us. Yet the truths they uncover are so important. So the task of taking the cookies off the shelf and putting them on the table to be enjoyed is incredibly exciting to me. That is what I am trying to do, and it is a thrilling process to be part of.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.6">For many of you readers, this commentary series may be the first ones you have ever read. I want this to be an exciting first foray into the world of the biblical texts, so that as you enter this adventure the journey is fun and filled with meaning. For others this commentary may be one of many you are consulting. Having done both kinds, the academic and the lay commentary, how will these commentaries enhance the more detailed coverage in the others. My recommendation is that you consult this one first to get a lay of the land, to see the whole field of meaning laid out for you before getting bogged down in the minutia of detail in the longer volumes. My commentary will help you to see the issues and understand them clearly so that you can get more out of all the confusing details in the others.</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.6">Just for fun, let me share on a question I am often asked. After all the decades of teaching and writing, do I have a favorite biblical theme or theological topic? I have reflected on my life’s verse an enormous amount, 2 Timothy 2:15, “Work very hard to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, correctly handling the word of truth.” That pictures me standing before God, ashamed because I have been shallow in my “handling” of his Word. My whole career has been an attempt to teach and preach his Word deeply and accurately, teaching my students to do the same. So a favorite topic has always been discipleship and the responsibility, but even more the joy and privilege, of communicating His Word to others. At the same time, I am known by students as a person whose favorite passage is the one I am on right now, as they hear me constantly say, “Wow, isn’t this a great verse?!”</p>
              <p class="text-left" style="color: #CECECE; line-height: 1.6">A final comment: I have been asked which of the commentaries in this series will best demonstrate these points. That is hard to say. For background information, the Gospels are best, because every passage will have a new set of historical background passages to uncover. I love historical background; it turns a two-dimensional lesson into a three-dimensional IMAX event. The hearer enters the world behind the text and experiences it anew through background. For sheer exciting new learning, the Book of Revelation cannot be beat. Most of us are a little afraid and confused by the bewildering images. Yet it is a truly wondrous book, and its message is so relevant for our day. I absolutely love teaching it! Among the epistles, it is a hard choice. For devotional value, I love Ephesians and Philippians (or 1 Peter for that matter); for theology, I love Romans or Hebrews. For practical church issues, 1 Corinthians is so valuable. Tough choices!</p>

              <span style="color: #CECECE;"><p class="text-left"><span style="color: #F7CFA5;">Editor’s Note</span>：On the occasion of Osborn’s seventieth birthday, his colleagues, friends and students, in honor of his many contributions to scholarship and the Church through his writings in the New Testament commentaries, prepared a Festschrift of 21 essays, which was published by Brill, an internationally renowned publishing house.

              <p style="color: #F7CFA5;">Grant R. Osborne, PhD.</p>                
              <p>Eckhard J. Schnabel and Stanley E. Porter<sup>[1]</sup></p>
              <p class="text-left">Grant R. Osborne was born on July 7, 1942, in Queens in New york City, where his parents were working as professional musicians. His father, a trumpet player, played with virtually every big band in town and beyond. during the Second World War the family moved to Fort Wayne, indi- ana, where they started to attend a local church and became committed Christians. Grant was introduced during his high school days to the seri- ous study of the Bible in meetings of youth for Christ, which prompted him to memorize books of the Old and New Testaments and eventu- ally to attend Fort Wayne Bible College, where he majored in missions and pastoral training. during his undergraduate studies, Grant served as a student worker with T.E.A.M. for six months, living in Abbottabad in North Pakistan. Since chronic bronchitis prevented missionary ministry overseas, Grant entered pastoral ministry, serving for three years as the pastor of First Christian Union Church in Newark, Ohio. Grant introduced expository preaching to the congregation while meeting the numerous and time-consuming expectations of his church, which included directing an all-churches choir (Grant conducted performances of Handel’s Mes- siah!). Experiencing the task of preparing three sermons each week as utterly stimulating, being invigorated by working consistently with the Greek text, Grant was eager and ready to engage in further studies. He enrolled at Trinity Evangelical divinity School in deerfield, illinois, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in New Testament studies in 1971. Tak- ing up the challenge of Richard Longenecker, one of his professors at TEdS, to earn a Ph.d. in Great Britain, Grant prepared for doctoral studies in Europe by teaching Greek and Hebrew at TEdS, driving a school bus, and filling in as interim pastor in a church in the Chicago area, while his wife Nancy, whom he had married during his Ohio days, taught elemen- tary school. Grant has the distinction of being the first doctoral student of i. Howard Marshall at Aberdeen University. His Ph.d. dissertation, with the title “History and Theology in the Resurrection Narratives: A Redac- tional Study,” was passed in 1974. dr. Osborne accepted a call to Winnipeg Theological Seminary (now Providence Theological Seminary) in Canada, where he taught from 1974 to 1977, and then moved to deerfield where he has been Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical divinity School since 1977 for thirty-five years. Grant has spent research semesters at the University of Cambridge in England and the Philipps-Universität in Marburg, Germany, and has lectured in Korea, Hong Kong, and the People’s Republic of China. He has served as New Testament editor of TSF News and Reviews, as general editor of the IVP New Testament Commentary series (interVarsity Press), and as one of the editors of the Life Application Commentary (Tyndale), the Three Crucial Questions series (Baker), and the New Living Translation.</p>
              <p class="text-left">A major area of interest of Professor Osborne has been hermeneutics, a fact that he connects with both his dissertation research and his mission- ary interests and pastoral duties, and which entails “moving” the mean- ing of Scripture from the biblical text to its contemporary listeners. Grant used the tools of redaction criticism, introduced twenty years earlier by Hans Conzelmann,<sup>7</sup> Willi Marxsen,8 and Günther Bornkamm,<sup>9</sup> in his dissertation on the resurrection narratives in the Gospels.<sup>10</sup> He revisited redaction criticism in several articles for dictionaries,<sup>11</sup> textbooks on exe- getical method,<sup>12</sup> journals,<sup>13</sup> and books,<sup>14</sup> defending the appropriateness of employing the techniques of redaction criticism in Gospel studies, espe- cially against evangelicals who argued that redaction criticism and a con- servative view of Scripture are incompatible.<sup>15</sup> Using a boxing metaphor, Grant describes the first round in the evangelical debate about redaction criticism as the attack by John Warwick Montgomery at the Annual Con- ference of the Evangelical Theological Society in 1978<sup>16</sup> against his 1976 and 1978 essays in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, against which he vigorously defended himself,<sup>17</sup> arguing that in no instance did he suggest that the evangelists created events or sayings of Jesus. The second round began with the publication of Robert Gundry’s commentary on the Gospel of Matthew,<sup>18</sup> which was criticized by some evangelical scholars.<sup>19</sup> The third round witnessed a symposium of evangelical scholars organized by Christianity Today,<sup>20</sup> and a position paper by the faculty of Talbot School of Theology.<sup>21</sup> A comment on the bout illustrates Grant’s willing- ness to change or modify a position that he held: responding to the charge that redaction critics tend to deny the possibility of harmonizing Gospel accounts in order to arrive at a chronological life of the historical Jesus, and that they tend to doubt the possibility of reconstructing the theology or the exact words of Jesus, he asserted in his 1986 essay, “i will admit that this applied to me for a while. in my original dissertation on the resurrec- tion narratives i played down the possibility of harmonizing the accounts. However, as i reworked my thesis over a period of seven years i gradually realized not only the viability but the importance of doing so to the extent that the data allowed.”<sup>22</sup> This openness to correction and continued learn- ing was evident in a recent Annual Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society when a student from his own divinity school (who was younger than the number of years Grant has been teaching) challenged a particu- lar position of his. At the end of the presentation, Grant raised his hand to comment, told the student that he convinced him, and emphasized that when you write you have to be willing to be wrong.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Unlike some scholars who devote their career to the use of one particu- lar method of interpretation, Grant has also written on historical criticism,<sup>23</sup> tradition criticism,<sup>24</sup> genre or form criticism,<sup>25</sup> literary theory,<sup>26</sup> typology,<sup>27</sup> contextualization,<sup>28</sup> and biblical Hermeneutics in general.<sup>29</sup> Of particular significance is his influential textbook The Hermeneutical Spiral,<sup>30</sup> which was a 1993 Christianity Today Critics’ Choice Award winner in theology and biblical studies. The hardcover edition of 1991 was followed by a paperback edition in 1997 and an expanded second edition in 2006. By October 2011, these three editions combined had sold over 50,000 copies.<sup>31</sup> it has been translated into Chinese, Hungarian, and Portuguese, and is in the process of being translated into Arabic, indonesian, and Korean.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Grant’s scholarship has not only been prodigious, but his direct influ- ence upon students has been profound as well. Many of the contributors to this volume were students of dr. Osborne at TEdS, and several served as his teaching assistants. To work with dr. Osborne was a privilege and created an opportunity to see him up close. it allowed the student to be able to talk with him more intimately about issues in ministry, especially in New Testament studies, and even to read and proofread his major works—to be in the know, as it were—before they appeared in print. it is hard to describe the privilege of having been asked to read and respond to an article that, one realized both then and now, took evangelical scholar- ship into previously uncharted waters. Students in dr. Osborne’s courses will remember the voluminous notes that he prepared for them to read in advance—in essence a compendium of scholarship on the respective topic or New Testament book—and that formed the backdrop for class- room discussion. The notes for a course in Hermeneutics were the basis of what was to become The Hermeneutical Spiral, one of Grant’s most significant publications. At the time the notes were written, students at TEdS were probably among the few in all of evangelical scholarship who were being exposed to structuralism and other less traditional forms of hermeneutical thought. One of the editors remembers vividly being in a Johannine literature course—at TEdS called Leftovers, because it was not the Synoptics or Acts and Paul—when, near the end of the course, one of the students asked dr. Osborne how he would preach a particular pas- sage using the material that had just been studied and discussed. imme- diately, and with great passion, dr. Osborne launched into what can only be described as a profound and deeply moving sermon—and not a short homily—on the Johannine passage, demonstrating both how to make the seamless transition from text and scholarship to application, and, perhaps more importantly, the spiritual fervor and genuine devotion to God’s word that Grant always professed and lived and continues to live before all of his students and colleagues. That impromptu sermon, born out of years of studying and meditating on God’s word, remains a vivid memory among many such memories from several years under Grant’s tutelage.</p>
              <p class="text-left">For Grant, the focus on Hermeneutics was never an end in itself nor a theoretical discipline, but invariably driven by theological and ultimately pastoral concerns, as several essays<sup>32</sup> and numerous dictionary entries<sup>33</sup> demonstrate. His preaching and teaching ministry in many churches in the Chicago area and beyond confirms his dedication to the church. One of the joys of his last ten years has been his strategic involvement in teaching pastors from mainland China. What seems to be Grant’s last major project corroborates this assessment: he has started working on a biblical theology of the church, proving the point that, for him, truly bibli- cal scholarship always benefits the church.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Colleagues and students have always appreciated Grant’s cordial agree- ability, cheerful disposition, unmitigated affirmation of friendship, deep humility, concern for the truth, and love of the Word of God. in addition, there is his sometimes hilariously self-deprecating sense of humor. it is quite possible that he will be embarrassed by this volume and the atten- tion that it directs his way. He may agree, however, that if the essays on commentary writing collected in this volume help scholars to write better commentaries and prompt pastors to preach better sermons, the overrid- ing concern of his own life as scholar, theologian, and pastor will have been served: Soli deo Gloria.</p>

              <p>At the beginning of Timothy’s Training International (TTi), Dr. Osborne proposed a vision, “To invite leading biblical scholars from around the world to teach every book of the Bible to fellow pastors and ministers of mainland China”. That was over 20 years ago. Since then, TTi has been following this vision and teaching the Bible faithfully.</p>
              <p>This webpage is our tribute to Dr. Osborne. It is also our wish that the vision of “teaching the Bible faithfully” will continue to inspire TTi’s coworkers and students to devote themselves to this ministry. May we, like Dr. Osborne and other pioneer saints, do our utmost in “rightly handling the word of truth” of the Bible (2 Tim 2:15), and spreading the fragrance of the life of Christ.</p>

He strongly encouraged me to study in an English-speaking seminary. “It’s just like when you wrote case studies in that American law school. If you could write legal memo, then you can study in an English-speaking seminary”, he said. I asked him, "Can women preach?" He gave me a clear answer, "Yes." "Can women serve as a leader?" Again he said clearly, "Sure."<br>
                  <br>I remembered and cherished Dr. Osborne for his nurturing, edification, encouragement to the students, and his help to students to fulfill their dreams. I am glad that I finally went abroad and finished my seminary studies. If there was any regret, it was that I should have taken his advice earlier to go abroad and study in a seminary.
                  <br>——Melissa<br>
                  <br>The first time I came to study at TTi, I took the course on Revelation with Dr. Osborne. His teaching helped me find interests in learning theology. I still remembered him saying in the course of Hermeneutics, "There is no such thing as boring theology, only bad teachers." Scot McKnight was a former student and colleague of Dr. Osborne, and as Scot recollected, Dr. Osborne suffered from chronic asthma throughout his lifetime, and he said the first thing he would do in heaven was to take a deep breath. Mcknight said that now Dr. Osborne can fully enjoy his breathing in the glory of God.
                  <br>——Reli<br>
                  <br>I took two intensive courses with Dr. Osborn: Romans, Jude and 1&2 Peter. I was so sad to hear that he passed away. I knew the Lord took him and I could not help crying. I remembered that back in June he was still talking in the video that he was planning on writing several commentaries, which we won't see anymore ......
                  <br>——Daniel<br>
                  <br>I have attended the intensive course twice in Hong Kong, and I chose the class of Dr. Osborne both times. Although I liked diversity, and I knew that the professors of other classes were also the best, and the opportunities were rare, Dr. Osborne’s class on Romans attracted me like a magnet. I could see what Jesus our Lord was like and felt the breath of his life in that class. As Dr. Osborne lectured on Romans, many passages that were confusing and difficult to me turned into refreshing living water. I remembered one of his analogies: sin is like an army that attempts to build bridgeheads at the weak points of our life, then breaks through the defenses of our life step by step ...... His expression was serious and his gestures were powerful when he gave that analogy, and I sensed his warning as well as exhortation to us. He was already weak when he taught us Romans, and he had to sit the whole week. But even though he was weak and frail he had the strength to teach. As he taught the Bible, he also lived out the strength in Christ, and his life testimony has had a long-lasting influence on my service to this day!
                  <br>——Daniel<br>
                  <br>I cried because I will never have the chance to listen to his Hermeneutics class again.
                  <br>——Michael<br>
                  <br>It was sad to hear that Dr. Osborne passed away. I recalled the classes I had taken with him, his powerful voice, and an unceasing vitality in his frail body. I was deeply touched by his passionate teaching and felt that he was also a shepherd who prayed. May he rest in peace in the Lord!
                  <br>——Moon<br>
                  <br>When I first heard the news of Dr. Osborne’s death, I was so sad that I didn't want to say anything. Now I have just calmed down a little bit. While Dr. Osborne was teaching the Book of Romans, I was taking Deuteronomy with Dr. Block, just next to Dr. Osborne’s class. I liked both courses, but I could only choose one. I was grateful that later we were able to study Romans with Dr. Osborne through the class videos, which took us 8 months to finish. 
                  <br>——Lily<br>
                  <br>Dr. Osborne had a great influence on me (although I never met him in person). After I took Dr. Osborne’s video class on Romans, I was moved to praying consistently for an opportunity to come and take intensive courses here. I miss him. 
                  <br>——Hong<br>
                  <br>I would like to listen to Dr. Osborne’s lectures again through the videos. His life is a great testimony. 
                  <br>——Linyun<br>
                  <br>It happened that last week I started reading the Commentary on Romans by Dr. Osborn. Unfortunately, I never took a course with him. Now after reading his commentary I would like to take a class from him.
                  <br>——Mist<br>
                  <br>"For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel." (Ezra 7:10 ) Dr. Osborne told us in his sermon, "This verse has defined my life." That testimony has stayed with me until this day!
                  <br>——Xiaoming<br>
                  <br>Thank you, Dr. Osborn! As you taught me the Hermeneutical Spiral of Bible exposition, I have been practicing it since then. The method has enabled me to taste the sweetness of God’s word when I allow the Bible to speak for itself. I have also learned to meditate day and night the word of God, so to keep it in my heart. These practice has helped me find the confession of my life: “To live is to serve, and to serve is to live”. I love you, Dr. Osborne! 
                  <br>——Gump<br>
                  <br>Dr. Osborne was like a real-life Santa Clause to me, a gentle and loving scholar-pastor. What impressed me the most in his class was not his proficiency in Greek, but his message of love through his teaching of truth. I was at the valley of my ministry back then, and when I heard him saying "God is good", I cried for half of the class. That was almost eight years ago, yet that memory is still fresh and alive today. I miss you, Dr. Osborne!
                  <br>——Betsy<br>
                  <br>Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! (Psalm 150:6) 
                  <br>——Zhishi<br>
                  <br>I was grateful that when I came to study at TTi, my first class was Romans taught by Dr. Osborne, which gave me a whole new perspective on “seminary courses”. Dr. Osborne was an Arminian, but he said, "I can list 30 verses from the Bible that support Arminianism and 30 verses that support Calvinism." I learned from Dr. Osborne’s profound knowledge and his own example that I should humble myself in the face of biblical truth, be tolerant and open to views that differ from my own position, and to learn with a humble heart. Dr. Osborne is a good example of mature Christian life. He was a best benchmark for me to learn from. 
                  <br>——Bryan<br>
                  <br>Now I think for those saints who suffered so much physically in this world, it is wonderful that they can rest in peace, awaiting the resurrection of their body! Although Dr. Osborne’s departure was a sad thing to his family and friends, yet we should rejoice that he was finally released.
